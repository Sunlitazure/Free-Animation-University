# Free Animation University
This is meant to be a comprehensive list of free courses that cover the depth and diversity of topics a university would offer.

It is intended for those who wish to learn animation as a hobby. Ideally it could help you make a portfolio good enough to possibly get a job, but is not meant to be an alternative to a degree for those wishing to do animation professionally.

Course requirements will be based on [this degree](http://catalog.utah.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=14&poid=16992&returnto=1548).
